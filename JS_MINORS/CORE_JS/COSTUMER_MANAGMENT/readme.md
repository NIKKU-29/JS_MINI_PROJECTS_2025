# Customer Management System

This is a simple **Customer Management System** built in JavaScript. It allows you to manage users by adding, removing, searching, and viewing all users. This project is intended for beginners to practice JavaScript concepts such as arrays, functions, and basic logic.

## Features

- **Add a User**: You can add a new customer to the system.
- **Remove a User**: You can remove an existing customer from the system.
- **Search for a User**: You can search for a user by name to check if they exist in the system.
- **Show All Users**: View all the users that have been added to the system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-management.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-management
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the Customer Management System.

## Usage

1. **Add a User**: 
   - Select option 1 and enter the name of the user you want to add.
   
2. **Remove a User**:
   - Select option 2 and enter the name of the user you want to remove. If the user exists, they will be removed from the system.

3. **Search a User**:
   - Select option 3 and enter the name of the user you want to search for. The system will notify you whether the user is found or not.

4. **Show All Users**:
   - Select option 4 to view all the customers in the system. The users will be displayed with their rank.

5. **Exit**:
   - Select option 5 to exit the program.

### Example:
```bash
WELCOME TO THE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
SELECT YOUR OPTIONS FROM BELOW
1. ADD A USER
2. REMOVE A USER
3. SEARCH A USER
4. SHOW ALL USERS
5. EXIT

ENTER YOUR CHOICE (1-5): 1
ADD NEW USER
ENTER THE NAME: John Doe

ENTER YOUR CHOICE (1-5): 4
SHOWING ALL USERS:
1. John Doe
```

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Main programming language used for logic and functionality.
- **Node.js** (Optional for `prompt-sync`): If you want to run it via Node.js with `prompt-sync`, you can install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  npm install prompt-sync
  ```

## File Structure

```
├── index.html             # Main HTML file
├── script.js              # JavaScript file for the app functionality
└── README.md              # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication (Admin and customer login).
- Validation and error handling for user inputs.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) using HTML and CSS to make it more user-friendly.
- Option to export the user list to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON).
